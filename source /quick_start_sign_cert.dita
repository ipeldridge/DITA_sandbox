    <title>Approving the Certificate Request</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>During installation, the agent node contacts the Puppet master and requests a
                certificate. To add the node to the console and to start managing its configuration,
                you need to approve its request on the Puppet master. This is most easily done via
                the console, as follows.</p>
