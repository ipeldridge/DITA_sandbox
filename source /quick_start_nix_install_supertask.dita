        operating systems. Refer to the [Windows agent installation quick start

        <context>
            <p>A computer running the PE agent is usually referred to as an <term>agent node</term>.
                The Puppet agent regularly pulls configuration catalogs from a Puppet master server
                and applies them to the local system.</p>
            <p>For more information about Puppet agents, as well as the components that make up your
                PE deployment, visit the <xref format="html"
