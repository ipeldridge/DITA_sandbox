    <title>PE Install Quick Start Guide</title>
    <shortdesc>To get you started using Puppet Enterprise (PE) relatively quickly and efficiently,
        this guide walks you through the steps of a monolithic install. A monolithic deployment is
        best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of
        puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes). For larger installations, you’ll need to perform a
        split install. </shortdesc>

        <prereq id="link">
            <p><b>Prerequisites</b>:</p>
            <ul id="ul_lcg_4n4_4q">
                <li>See the <xref format="html"
                        href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/install_system_requirements.html#evaluation-environment"
                        >system requirements</xref> to ensure your hardware needs are met.</li>
                <li>Make sure that DNS is properly configured on the machines you're installing PE
                    on. All nodes must <b>know their own hostnames</b>. This can be done by properly
                    configuring reverse DNS on your local DNS server, or by setting the hostname
                    explicitly. Setting the hostname usually involves the <codeph>hostname</codeph>
                    command and one or more configuration files, while the exact method varies by
                    platform. In addition, all nodes must be able to <b>reach each other by
                    name</b>.  This can be done with a local DNS server, or by editing the
                        <codeph>/etc/hosts</codeph> file on each node to point to the proper IP
                    addresses.</li>
                <li>Please ensure that port 3000 is reachable, as the web-based installer uses this
                    port. You can close this port when the installation is complete.</li>
            </ul>
        </prereq>
        <context>A monolithic PE deployment entails installing the puppet master, the PE console,
            and PuppetDB all on one node. Puppet agent nodes are installed later as part of the
            [agent installation quick start guide for *nix](./quick_start_install_agents_nix.html)
            or the [agent installation quick start guide for
            Windows](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html). For more information about the
            components that make up your PE deployment, visit the [installation
            overview](./install_basic.html) in the PE docs.</context>

                    needed, copy the tarball to the machine on which you'll be installing PE.</cmd>
                <info>Be sure to download the full PE tarball, not the agent-only tarball. The
                    agent-only tarball is used for <xref format="html"

            <step>
                <cmd>When prompted, choose "Yes" to install the setup packages. (If you choose "No,"
                    the installer will exit.)</cmd>
                <stepresult> At this point, the PE installer will start a web server and provide a

                    Please ensure that port 3000 is reachable. If necessary, you can close port 3000
                    when the installation is complete. Also be sure to use
                        <codeph>https</codeph>.<p>Leave your terminal connection open until the
                        installation is complete; otherwise the installation will

                        may take up to 10-15 minutes.</b> When the installation is complete, the

        <result>You have now installed the puppet master node. As indicated by the installer, the
            puppet master node is also an agent node, and can configure itself the same way it
            configures the other nodes in a deployment. Stay logged in as root for further
            exercises.</result>
