fil["0"]= "quick_start_install_mono.html@@@PE Install Quick Start Guide@@@To get you started using Puppet Enterprise (PE) relatively quickly and efficiently, this guide walks you through the steps of a monolithic install. A monolithic deployment is best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes). For larger installations, you’ll need to perform a [split install](./install_pe_split.html). A monolithic PE deployment entails installing the puppet master, the PE console, and PuppetDB all on one node. Puppet agent nodes are installed later as part of the [agent installation quick start guide for *nix](./quick_start_install_agents_nix.html) or the [agent installation quick start guide for Windows](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html). For more information about the components that make up your PE deployment, visit the [installation overview](./install_basic.html) in the PE docs...";

Modules contain [classes](../puppet/3/reference/lang_classes.html), which are named chunks of puppet code and are the primary means by which Puppet Enterprise configures and manages nodes. While you can use any module available on the Forge, PE customers can take advantage of [supported modules](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/supported); these modules--designed to make common services easier--are tested, and maintained by Puppet Labs. In the [Module Writing Basics for Linux QSG](./quick_writing_nix.html) you ll learn more about modules, including customizing and writing your own modules on either [Windows](./quick_writing_windows.html) or [*nix](./quick_writing_nix.html) platforms...";
