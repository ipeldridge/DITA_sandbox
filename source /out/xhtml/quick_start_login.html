Whether you’re setting up a PE installation for actual deployment or want to learn some fundamentals of configuration management with Puppet Enterprise, this series of guides provides the steps you need to get up and running relatively quickly. We’ll walk you through the setup of a monolithic (all-in-one node) installation and show you how to automate some basic tasks that sysadmins regularly perform.">Puppet Enterprise Quick Start Guide</a></div>

A monolithic deployment is best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes).

Modules contain [classes](../puppet/3/reference/lang_classes.html), which are named chunks of puppet code and are the primary means by which Puppet Enterprise configures and manages nodes. While you can use any module available on the Forge, PE customers can take advantage of [supported modules](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/supported); these modules--designed to make common services easier--are tested, and maintained by Puppet Labs. In the [Module Writing Basics for Linux QSG](./quick_writing_nix.html) you'll learn more about modules, including customizing and writing your own modules on either [Windows](./quick_writing_windows.html) or [*nix](./quick_writing_nix.html) platforms.">Module Installation Quick Start Guide</a></div>
