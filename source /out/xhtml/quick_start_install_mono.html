    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">To get you started using Puppet Enterprise (PE) relatively quickly and efficiently,
        this guide walks you through the steps of a monolithic install. A monolithic deployment is
        best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of
        puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes). For larger installations, you’ll need to perform a
        [split install](./install_pe_split.html). A monolithic PE deployment entails installing the
        puppet master, the PE console, and PuppetDB all on one node. Puppet agent nodes are
        installed later as part of the [agent installation quick start guide for
        *nix](./quick_start_install_agents_nix.html) or the [agent installation quick start guide
        for Windows](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html). For more information about the

                    requirements](./install_system_requirements.html#monolithic-all-in-one-installation)
                    to ensure your hardware needs are met.</li>

                <li class="li">Make sure that DNS is properly configured on the machines you're installing PE
                    on. All nodes must **know their own hostnames.** This can be done by properly
                    configuring reverse DNS on your local DNS server, or by setting the hostname
                    explicitly. Setting the hostname usually involves the `hostname` command and one
                    or more configuration files, while the exact method varies by platform. In
                    addition, all nodes must be able to **reach each other by name.** This can be
                    done with a local DNS server, or by editing the `/etc/hosts` file on each node
                    to point to the proper IP addresses.</li>

                <li class="li">Please ensure that port 3000 is reachable, as the web-based installer uses this
                    port. You can close this port when the installation is complete.</li>
