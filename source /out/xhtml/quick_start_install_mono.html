                <li class="li">Make sure that DNS is properly configured on the machines you're installing PE

                    configuring reverse DNS on your local DNS server, or by setting the hostname
                    explicitly. Setting the hostname usually involves the <samp class="ph codeph">hostname</samp>
                    command and one or more configuration files, while the exact method varies by
                    platform. In addition, all nodes must be able to <strong class="ph b">reach each other by
                    name</strong>.  This can be done with a local DNS server, or by editing the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> file on each node to point to the proper IP
                    addresses.</li>
