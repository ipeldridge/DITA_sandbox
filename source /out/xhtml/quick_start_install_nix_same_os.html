            up and running on one node. If you have not already done this, refer to the <a class="xref" href="quick_start_install_mono.html#task_xwm_nl4_4q" title="To get you started using Puppet Enterprise (PE) relatively quickly and efficiently, this guide walks you through the steps of a monolithic install. A monolithic deployment is best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes). For larger installations, you’ll need to perform a [split install](./install_pe_split.html). A monolithic PE deployment entails installing the puppet master, the PE console, and PuppetDB all on one node. Puppet agent nodes are installed later as part of the [agent installation quick start guide for *nix](./quick_start_install_agents_nix.html) or the [agent installation quick start guide for Windows](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html). For more information about the components that make up your PE deployment, visit the [installation overview](./install_basic.html) in the PE docs.">PE Install Quick Start Guide</a>.</div>
