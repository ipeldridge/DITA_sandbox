To get you started using Puppet Enterprise (PE) relatively quickly and efficiently,         this guide walks you through the steps of a monolithic install. A monolithic deployment is         best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of         puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes). For larger installations, you’ll need to perform a         split install. </li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a href="quick_start_login.html">Log in to the PE Console</a><br/>
To log in to the console, you can select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Start Using Puppet Enterprise             Now</span>button that appears at the end of the web-based installer or follow the         steps below.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a href="quick_start_nix_install_supertask.html">Installing *nix Agents</a><br/>
The following instructions are for installing Puppet agents on nodes running *nix         operating systems. Refer to the [Windows agent installation quick start         guide](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html) for instructions on installing Puppet         agents on nodes running supported versions of the Windows OS.</li>

In this guide, you'll install the puppetlabs-apache module, a Puppet Enterprise         supported module. Modules contain [classes](../puppet/3/reference/lang_classes.html), which         are named chunks of puppet code and are the primary means by which Puppet Enterprise         configures and manages nodes. While you can use any module available on the Forge, PE         customers can take advantage of [supported modules](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/supported);         these modules--designed to make common services easier--are tested, and maintained by Puppet         Labs. In the [Module Writing Basics for Linux QSG](./quick_writing_nix.html) you'll learn         more about modules, including customizing and writing your own modules on either         [Windows](./quick_writing_windows.html) or [*nix](./quick_writing_nix.html)         platforms.</li>

In this guide, you'll create a new node group, apply rules to the group to define the         nodes it will include, and add classes to the group. You'll also create a new user role and         give the role view permissions on your node group. Finally, you’ll create a new local user,         and assign a user role to that user. </li>
