    <shortdesc>To log in to the console, you can select the <uicontrol>Start Using Puppet Enterprise
            Now</uicontrol>button that appears at the end of the web-based installer or follow the
        steps below.</shortdesc>

            <step>
                <cmd><b>On your control workstation</b>, open a web browser and point it to the
                    address supplied by the installer; for example,
                        <codeph>https://master.example.com</codeph>.</cmd>
                <stepresult>You will receive a warning about an untrusted certificate. This is
                    because _you_ were the signing authority for the console's certificate, and your
                    Puppet Enterprise deployment is not known to the major browser vendors as a
                    valid signing authority. <b>Ignore the warning and accept the certificate</b>.
                    The steps to do this [vary by browser](./console_accessing.html).</stepresult>
