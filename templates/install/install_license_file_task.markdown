<!--Tasks describe a procedure the user performs. Tasks typically include 7 or fewer steps. Consider breaking longer tasks into a multi-task process. Avoid shoehorning conceptual or reference information into tasks so that the task is more navigable and reusable.-->

To install the license key:

1. On the Puppet master, copy the file to `/etc/puppetlabs/license.key`.
