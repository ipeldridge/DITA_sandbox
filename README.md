DITA Sandbox
============

A place for testing DITA via the Puppet Enterprise QSG.

I'll try to keep this README updated as the experiments change. 

## Source

Contains task topics that I've ported over from the PE QSG .md files into DITA. `PE_QSG.ditamap` is the current map; it uses the conref strategy explained below.  

### Notes

I was doing some weird stuff here, trying to see what it took to get multiple topics on page. You'll probably want to reset the weird link attributes I set up, which you can review in a previous version of this README.
