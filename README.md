DITA Sandbox
============

A place for testing DITA via the Puppet Enterprise QSG.

### Source Files

Contains some task topics that I've been porting over from the PE QSG .md files into DITA. This directory contains a DITA map that I've been tinkering with to figure out how best to arrange topics in terms of TOC and various linking strategies. This map is currently an f-ing mess, but if you want to use it, you can clear the *chunking*, *linking*, and *toc* attributes from either the map or the topicrefs in the map.  

#### experiment files

Contains topics with little-to-no content if you just want to move stuff around to see what it looks like.
