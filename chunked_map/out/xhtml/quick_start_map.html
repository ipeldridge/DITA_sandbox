    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">To get you started using Puppet Enterprise (PE) relatively quickly and efficiently,
        this guide walks you through the steps of a monolithic install. A monolithic deployment is
        best suited for users who want to evaluate PE, or for users managing a small number of
        puppet agent nodes (up to 500 nodes). For larger installations, you’ll need to perform a
        split install. </p>

                <li class="li">Make sure that DNS is properly configured on the machines you're installing PE
                    on. All nodes must <strong class="ph b">know their own hostnames</strong>. This can be done by properly
                    configuring reverse DNS on your local DNS server, or by setting the hostname
                    explicitly. Setting the hostname usually involves the <samp class="ph codeph">hostname</samp>
                    command and one or more configuration files, while the exact method varies by
                    platform. In addition, all nodes must be able to <strong class="ph b">reach each other by
                    name</strong>.  This can be done with a local DNS server, or by editing the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/hosts</samp> file on each node to point to the proper IP
                    addresses.</li>

                <li class="li">Please ensure that port 3000 is reachable, as the web-based installer uses this
                    port. You can close this port when the installation is complete.</li>
